Commercial Support
==================

INEX itself has limited resources but are eager for **IXP Manager** to become the de facto
management system for similar IXPs and are willing to help with installations so as to build
better documentation. We will consider feature requests, especially where they benefit INEX
also and would certainly love feature patches!

If you want commercial support, please contact the authors directly for a quote:

Any code developed commercially or otherwise will be released under the same license as **IXP Manager**
for the benefit of all.
